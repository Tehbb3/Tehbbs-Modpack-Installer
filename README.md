# Tehbbs-Modpack-Installer
A modpack installer that I created to make things easier for others when installing mods


you will have to create the directory structure like this:

(any folder)

|-run.bat

|-(data)

..  |-forge.jar
  
..  |-(mods)
  
....    |-(Put your mods in here)
    




if you type "console" from the initial y/n prompt it will take you to a console
from there you can use the "help" command to list all documented commands or functions


:note
you may have to run this command:

Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine
in powershell due to the way colors are genorated
